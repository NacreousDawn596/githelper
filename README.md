# githelper
a simple python script made for begginers who don't know how to make a markdown file or a setup file correctly

# How to download it:

```sh
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/NacreousDawn596/githelper
cd githelper
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

now you can launch it by writing *githelp* on the desired directory after reopening the terminal. enjoy!
